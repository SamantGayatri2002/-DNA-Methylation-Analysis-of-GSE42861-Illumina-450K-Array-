# 📌 Background on Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and DNA Methylation

## 🦠 Why Study Methylation in Rheumatoid Arthritis?

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent inflammation, synovial hyperplasia, and progressive joint destruction. Although genetic factors contribute to susceptibility — such as HLA-DRB1 “shared epitope” alleles — genetic variation alone does not fully explain who develops RA or why disease severity varies so widely among patients.

This gap between genetic risk and clinical presentation suggests an important role for epigenetic regulation, particularly **DNA methylation**, which acts as a dynamic mediator between environmental factors and immune cell function.

DNA methylation influences key immune processes, including:

- T-cell activation and differentiation  
- B-cell antibody production  
- Cytokine signaling networks (TNF, IL6, IL1β)  
- Inflammatory gene expression programs  
- Integration of environmental triggers such as smoking, diet, pollution, and infections  

Because RA is fundamentally a disease of immune dysregulation, methylation patterns within blood-derived immune cells reflect both functional states and pathological activity.

## 🧬 A Quick Guide to Hypomethylation and Hypermethylation

DNA methylation at CpG sites can either increase (**hypermethylation**) or decrease (**hypomethylation**). Both changes can strongly influence immune responses.

### 🟦 Hypomethylation

**Definition**  
A reduction in methylation at a CpG site (lower beta value).

**Biological meaning**

- Loosens chromatin structure  
- Often associated with **increased gene expression**, especially at promoters or enhancers  
- Commonly seen during immune activation  
- Can reflect inflammation, cell proliferation, or stress-response signaling  

**In RA**  
Studies repeatedly observe hypomethylation in:

- Cytokine signaling genes  
- MHC region genes  
- T-cell activation pathways  
- NF-κB–related promoters  

This indicates that RA immune cells may be epigenetically “primed” toward inflammatory behavior.

### 🟥 Hypermethylation

**Definition**  
An increase in methylation at a CpG site (higher beta value).

**Biological meaning**

- Condenses chromatin  
- Often associated with **reduced gene expression**  
- Can silence genes involved in immune suppression or tolerance  
- May enhance autoimmunity by suppressing anti-inflammatory programs  

**In RA**  
Hypermethylation can appear in genes related to:

- Immune regulation  
- Pathways that normally restrict inflammation  
- Synovial fibroblast growth control  

Together, the imbalance between hypomethylation (activation) and hypermethylation (silencing) contributes to chronic inflammation in RA.

## 🧬 What Have Previous Methylation Studies Shown in RA?

Across many studies, RA-associated CpGs show consistent patterns.

### 🔹 Hypomethylation commonly occurs in:

- Innate and adaptive immune signaling  
- TLR (Toll-like receptor) pathways  
- Interferon signaling  
- T-cell receptor activation regions  
- Cytokine promoters (TNF, IL6, IL1 family)  

### 🔹 Hypermethylation commonly occurs in:

- Regulatory T-cell function genes  
- Genes controlling apoptosis  
- Pathways limiting synovial fibroblast expansion  

### 🔹 Frequently dysregulated pathways include:

- Cell adhesion and migration  
- Antigen presentation  
- Chronic inflammatory signaling  
- Extracellular matrix remodeling  

These reinforce the idea that RA immune cells undergo widespread epigenetic reprogramming.

## 🧪 Why Use the GSE42861 Dataset?

GSE42861 is widely used for methylation learning and benchmarking because:

- ✔ **Large cohort** — hundreds of samples  
- ✔ **Multiple immune cell types** — supports comparative analysis  
- ✔ **High-quality IDATs** — strong signal, low failure rates  
- ✔ **Clear RA vs. control design**  
- ✔ **Well-documented and widely cited**  

Your smaller subset of six samples is still useful for:

- Understanding methylation workflows  
- Running QC and normalization  
- Practicing annotation and enrichment  
- Producing interpretive plots (PCA, volcano, enrichment)  

---

## 📌 Summary

RA is epigenetically complex. DNA methylation plays a central role in shaping immune activity, and the balance between **hypomethylation** (activation) and **hypermethylation** (silencing) helps explain how immune pathways become chronically dysregulated.

Using a real dataset like **GSE42861** provides practical experience in identifying CpG-level differences and connecting them to disease biology.
